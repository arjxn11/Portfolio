## The Project

With dining contributing up to 50% of hotel revenue in India, customer sentiment toward hotel restaurants plays a critical role in business success. This project analyzed **147,581 TripAdvisor reviews** from hotel restaurants in New Delhi using advanced NLP techniques to extract **actionable insights** about food quality, service, pricing, and ambiance. The goal was to help hospitality businesses identify pain points, improve customer experience, and refine strategic positioning.

## Methodology and Implementation

-   **Sentiment Classification**

    -   Models Used: RoBERTa (transformer-based), VADER (lexicon-based)

    -   **RoBERTa** was fine-tuned using a **balanced subset of \~12,000 reviews** and achieved **\~80% accuracy**, outperforming raw star ratings in detecting nuanced and mixed-sentiment reviews.

    -   VADER was used in tandem to support aspect-level analysis due to its interpretability.

-   **Topic Modeling (LDA)**

    -   Performed separately on positive and negative reviews to reduce topic overlap.

    -   Topics uncovered included **“Cold Food,” “Rude Staff,” “Overpriced Items,”** and **“Clean Ambiance.”**

-   **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**

    -   Aspects (e.g., food, service, price) were matched with sentiment scores.

    -   Visualization showed “Service” had the **highest frequency of negative mentions**, often tied to the terms “rude” and “slow.”

-   **Opinion–Sentiment Triplet Extraction**

    -   Combined **PyABSA + spaCy** to extract triplets like *(food, tasteless, negative)* or *(service, excellent, positive)*.

    -   Focused on **\~12,000 negative reviews** to efficiently surface critical insights.

    -   Top triplets included:

        -   *(service, rude, negative)* – 125 mentions

        -   *(food, not good, negative)* – 84 mentions

        -   *(ambience, dirty, negative)* – 43 mentions

-   **Geospatial & Brand Insights**

    -   Price perception heatmaps revealed **Taj and Sheraton** as consistently labeled “expensive.”

    -   Areas like **Connaught Place** had more “affordable” mentions.

    -   **Chicken dishes** dominated food-related complaints, especially *grilled chicken* labeled as “cold” or “bland.”

## Results

-   **Sentiment Distribution** (RoBERTa classified):

    -   Positive: **74.7%**

    -   Neutral: **17.3%**

    -   Negative: **8%**

    -   Despite the skew, **negative reviews offered the most actionable insights**.

-   **Error Reduction**:

    -   RoBERTa corrected misaligned ratings, identifying sentiment mismatch in **dozens of reviews** where a high star rating masked negative text.

-   **Model Comparison** (Appendix C Summary):

    | Model | Accuracy | Pros | Notes |
    |----|----|----|----|
    | RoBERTa | \~0.80 | Strong context handling | Best for final classification |
    | VADER | \~0.84\* | Easy to interpret, rule-based | Best for aspect scoring |
    | Logistic Reg. | \~0.70 | Fast and simple | Baseline model |
    | Llama 3.1 | N/A | Context-rich but resource-intensive | Not used in final pipeline |

<!-- -->

-   **Temporal Insights**:

    -   Interest in *ambiance* and *service* spiked pre-pandemic.

    -   Post-2020, new terms like *lockdown*, *sanitizer*, and *hygiene* surged.

    -   Shifted priorities toward *safety* and *value for money*.

## Conclusion

This project successfully translated unstructured reviews into **structured intelligence** through a hybrid NLP pipeline. Our approach enabled fine-grained feedback analysis, helping restaurant managers pinpoint **key operational failures** and **differentiators**. From identifying **specific pain points (e.g., slow staff at expensive outlets)** to spotting **emerging trends in customer expectations**, the model serves as a scalable blueprint for real-time review monitoring in hospitality.
